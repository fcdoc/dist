However, as monitoring systems continue to expand, a massive number of alerts and event notifications are generated, presenting unprecedented challenges to IT teams. Ensuring that every alert is captured in a timely manner, delivered accurately, and responded to effectively has become a critical factor in maintaining service quality.</p><p>Faced with this challenge, we have identified the following scenarios that indicate organizations need to introduce or upgrade their On-Call tools:</p><ul><li><strong>Comprehensive Tracking and Resolution</strong>: Ensure that every incident can be tracked, processed, and resolved to prevent the problem from escalating and thereby avoid greater asset losses.</li><li><strong>Establishment of a Duty Mechanism</strong>: Establish a clear On-Call personnel duty mechanism, including a primary and backup shift system, to reasonably distribute responsibilities and avoid alert overload.</li><li><strong>Improving Response Efficiency</strong>: When SRE or R&amp;D personnel spend more than 25% of their time on On-Call duties, tools are needed to reduce noise and improve work efficiency.</li><li><strong>Establishment of Quantitative Metrics</strong>: Establish metrics for incident processing timeliness and personnel workload to drive continuous improvement in service stability through data.</li></ul><p><strong>&quot;What key factors should we consider when purchasing On-Call services?&quot;</strong> This guide will provide comprehensive On-Call tool purchasing recommendations. We will examine the three dimensions of <strong>product</strong>, <strong>service</strong>, and <strong>price</strong> to explore the questions IT managers should ask when seeking efficient collaboration and incident management solutions for their development and operations teams. Additionally, for each dimension, we will provide a comparative analysis of mainstream domestic and international On-Call suppliers such as Flashduty and Pagerduty to help you make an informed decision.</p><h3>Product</h3><h4>Integration Capabilities</h4><p>The incident management system serves as a process handling center, storing all alert and incident data. Such systems should support robust data access and outbound call capabilities to integrate with other systems or workflows, accelerating response times and enhancing collaboration.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Product Capabilities</th><th>Questions to Consider</th><th>Flashduty vs. Pagerduty</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Alert Integration</strong></td><td>1.  Does it support your commonly used alert system? <br> 2. Does it support custom alert integration? Can it report self-developed script monitoring data through standard protocols? <br> 3.
