A duty schedule is used for receiving incidents and is responsible for receiving and processing incidents assigned to the duty team. In contrast, a service calendar is used for dispatching incidents and determines which time periods incidents should be dispatched, serving as the upper layer for the receiver. The service calendar is commonly used in the securities industry, for example, to focus on business that only trades on weekdays.
