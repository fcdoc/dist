This can significantly reduce the frequency of notifications and improve handling efficiency</h2><h1>Configure Alert Noise Reduction</h1><h2>Set Alert Aggregation</h2><p>Go to [Collaboration Space Details] - [ Alert reduction], you can set the <strong>alert aggregation</strong> strategy. When creating a new collaboration space, alert is turned off by default. It is recommended that you manually turn it on and set aggregation policies as needed.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE]
When alert aggregation is not enabled, each alert will create a separate incident, and the basic information of the two will be exactly the same.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Aggregation Dimensions: A space can have multiple sets of default aggregation dimensions. If any set of dimensions matches, the alert is considered similar to the incident and can be merged.</p></li><li><p>If you wish to分流处理不同的 alerts, please turn on <strong>fine-grained control</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Fine-grained control allows you to filter incidents and set specific aggregation dimensions.</p></li><li><p>The system always prioritizes matching fine-grained controls. If no match is found, the default aggregation dimensions will be used.</p></li><li><p>You can go to <a href="/conf/how_to_filter">Configure Filters</a> to learn how to configure filters.</p></li><li><p>Aggregation Window: You can choose to aggregate only recently occurring alerts (with stronger correlation), and alerts that exceed the time window will trigger a new incident. <strong>Note that this window is a sliding window and always extends as new alerts are merged</strong>.</p></li><li><p>It is generally recommended that you use the average arrival time of alerts as the aggregation window. For example, 10 minutes.</p></li><li><p>Storm Warning: After an incident is triggered, the system will immediately dispatch and notify (assuming you have not set a delayed notification), and then continue to merge new alerts, <strong>but no new notifications will be triggered</strong>. This can cause you to miss an alert storm. Therefore, we provide this threshold. When the number of merged alerts reaches the threshold, the system will trigger a storm warning to remind you to expedite handling.</p></li><li><p>We always recommend enabling storm warnings.</p></li><li><p>Preview: You can use the preview function to pull recent events and render the noise reduction results in real time to evaluate the noise reduction effect. The system can pull up to <code>666</code> historical events.</p></li></ul><img src="https://fcimg.3ti.site/zh/flashduty/alter/what_is_noise_reduction/2.avif" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" height="400"><h2>See Aggregation Examples</h2><p>Set the space to aggregate by <strong>alert check items</strong>. The system received 5 alert notifications in sequence, which triggered alerts and incidents in turn:</p><pre><code class="language-i18n">Fault: cpu idle &lt; 20% / es.nj.03, Critical

- Alert: CPU Idle&lt; 20% / es.nj.03:
- Event 1: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 10%, Critical
- Event 2: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 18%, Warning
- Event 4: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 10%, Ok

- Alert: CPU Idle&lt; 20% / es.nj.01:
- Event 3: es.nj.01, cpu.idle = 15%, Warning

- Alert: CPU Idle&lt; 20% / es.nj.02:
- Event 5: es.nj.02, cpu.idle = 19%, Warning

You can manually modify the incident title at any time. This title will not change with the merging of new alerts.
</code></pre><p>|+| Will the incident labels change when alerts are merged?</p><pre><code>- Manually created alerts: No, their label list will always be empty
- Automatically triggered alerts: Possibly, the incident labels will be consistent with the labels of the first alert that triggered the incident. If the alert labels change, the incident labels will also change synchronously.
</code></pre><p>|+| Will the alert labels change as events are merged?</p><pre><code>Yes, the alert labels will always be consistent with the newly merged events. For example, if you receive an alert &quot;CPU Idle Low&quot; at 10 o'clock with a trigger value of 10%, as more events are merged, the trigger value label may change dynamically. However, if the newly received event is a recovery event, the alert will keep the existing labels unchanged and add any new labels that did not exist before. Our principle is to keep the labels displayed by the alert as close as possible to their state at the time of triggering.
</code></pre><p>|+| Is there an upper limit on the number of alerts that can be merged into an incident?</p><pre><code>Yes, we have set a limit of up to 1,000 alerts per incident. This is mainly to reduce the rendering time of the console page. However, Flashduty is a high-performance event processing system with a lot of concurrent logic in the background, so when you see an incident aggregating more than 1,000 alerts, this is a possible normal phenomenon.
</code></pre><p>|+| Is there an upper limit on the number of events that can be merged into an alert?</p><pre><code>No. However, the maximum window for an alert to merge events is 24 hours. This means that if an alert is triggered and has not been resolved within 24 hours, no new events will be merged in the future. If Flashduty receives a new event, a new alert will be generated.
</code></pre><p>|+| Why do the number of events I push and the number of events associated with the alert not match?</p><pre><code>The merging of events into alerts is also a noise reduction process. If Flashduty determines that the newly reported event and the alert have not changed significantly (for example, the status, severity, and description have not changed), Flashduty will discard the newly reported event and use the labels from the new event to overwrite the existing labels.
