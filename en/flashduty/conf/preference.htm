This means that if you do not set a dispatch policy, there will be no notification when an incident occurs.

Secondly, the dispatch policy single chat notification channel supports two settings: one is &quot;follow personal preference&quot; and the other is &quot;follow unified settings&quot;. Only in the &quot;Follow personal preferences&quot; setting will notifications be personalized according to your settings. If you select &quot;Follow unified settings&quot;, everyone will be notified according to this setting, rather than each person's preference.

Go to Collaboration Space Details =&gt; Dispatch Strategy to view your specific settings.
