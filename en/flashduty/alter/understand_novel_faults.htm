If an incident is identified as novel, incident responders should be alert. This is particularly important for OnCall engineers, as the impact of novel incidents may be unknown, and their handling procedures may require on-the-spot decisions. Some engineers may focus solely on novel incidents, developing standardized processes or SOPs to address them.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE]
