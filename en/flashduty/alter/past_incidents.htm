The historical incident feature provides responders with a list of similar incidents that have already been resolved. For responders unfamiliar with the issue, they can quickly review the timeline, root cause, and solution of historical incidents and replicate the relevant actions. Historical incidents provide the necessary context for problem-solving and help prevent responders from feeling overwhelmed when encountering unfamiliar issues.</p><blockquote><p>[!NOTE]
This feature is currently in beta and is only available in the Professional version and above. If you need to enable this feature, please contact us at any time.</p></blockquote><h2>View Similar Incidents</h2><h3>Console</h3><ol><li>From the incident list or collaboration space, find an incident that needs to be processed;</li><li>Click the incident title to enter the incident details, and select the <strong>Historical Incidents</strong> tab.</li></ol><p><img src="https://fc.3ti.site/zh/flashduty/alter/past_incidents/1.avif" alt="" /></p><p>The system will provide up to 5 similar historical incidents to avoid overwhelming you with too much information.</p><h3>Sorting Principle</h3><p>How do we sort?</p><ol><li>The system only matches incidents with a similarity greater than 90%;</li><li>The system prioritizes incidents with more detailed solutions and root causes;</li><li>The system prioritizes incidents with higher similarity;</li><li>The system prioritizes more recent incidents.</li></ol><blockquote><p>[!NOTE]
Leaving <strong>solutions</strong> and <strong>root causes</strong> when resolving an incident is a good habit. This will greatly improve the response speed for future incidents.</p></blockquote><h3>How to Identify</h3><p>The system uses a machine learning model to determine the similarity between incidents. When the similarity is greater than 90%, we consider the two incidents to be similar.</p><p>When judging similarity, we mainly consider the following factors:</p><ol><li>Title of the incident</li><li>Detailed description of the incident</li><li>The service affected by the incident (generally extracted from the service tag)</li><li>The alert object in the incident (generally extracted from the resource tag)</li></ol><p>When searching for historical incidents, the system only matches similar incidents that have been resolved in the current collaboration space.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>|+| How far back can I view historical incidents?</p><pre><code>Currently, you can only view similar incidents within 30 days before the current incident. Over time, the system may delete historical data, in which case you may not be able to view historical incidents.

Regardless, for the current incident, you can review up to 30 days of historical data.
</code></pre><p>|+| Can I mark that the current incident is not similar to historical incidents?</p><pre><code>No, the system currently does not have a marking function. However, you can communicate and provide feedback to us through other channels.
</code></pre><p>|+| How can I make historical incidents more effective?</p><pre><code>1. We recommend that you fill in the root causes and solutions for important incidents;
2. We recommend that you enrich the incident tags, especially the service and resource tags;
3. We recommend that you enrich the title and description of the alert to more accurately describe the incident.
