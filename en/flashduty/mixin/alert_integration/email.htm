</code></pre><h3>Customize Email Integration</h3><h4>Email Address</h4><p>By default, the system will generate a unique email address for you. You can modify it, but note that <strong>the email prefix can only consist of letters and numbers</strong> and must be unique within your account.</p><h4>Push Mode</h4><p>By default, the system always creates a new alert for each email, but you can switch the mode to:</p><ol><li><strong>Trigger or update alert based on email subject</strong>: In this mode, whenever a new email is received, the system will search for an unclosed alert based on the email subject. If an alert is found, it will be updated; otherwise, the system will trigger a new alert.</li><li><strong>Trigger or close alert based on rules</strong>: In this mode, whenever a new email is received, the system will match the email according to your rules, and the matched emails will trigger a new alert or close an existing alert according to the rules.</li></ol><ul><li>You need to fill in at least one <strong>trigger</strong> rule</li><li>You must set the regular expression extraction rules for the Alert Key. The system uses this field to find historical alerts for updating or closing; <strong>if the regular expression extraction fails, the system will use the email subject to generate the Alert Key</strong> to ensure that the alert is not lost due to misconfiguration</li><li>You can choose whether to discard emails when none of the rules match.</li></ul><p>Configuration Example:</p><ul><li>Receive all emails. When the email content contains the word <strong>RESOLVED</strong>, close the alert; otherwise, trigger a new alert</li><li>The Alert Key is extracted from the email subject, with the rule being <strong>/(.*)/</strong>.</li></ul><img src="https://fc.3ti.site/zh/flashduty/mixin/alert_integration/email/1.avif" alt="drawing" width="800"/><h3>Things to Note</h3><ol><li>If the email message body is larger than 5MB, the system will directly refuse to receive it.</li><li>If the text content of the email exceeds 32KB, the system will truncate it and add a label prompt in the incident details:</li></ol><pre><code>body_cut = true
</code></pre><ol start="3"><li>If the email contains an attachment, the system will discard the attachment and add a label prompt in the incident details:</li></ol><pre><code>attachment_stripped = true
</code></pre><ol start="4"><li><p>In the new alert triggered by email, <strong>the title is the email subject, and the description is the email content</strong>.</p></li><li><p>If you change your account domain name, this email address will also change. Be sure to update your push address.</p></li></ol><h2>Severity Mapping Relationship</h2><p>The current alert levels pushed to Flashduty by email integration are all set to Warning.</p></article><nav><a href="/">doc.flashduty.com</a><a href="/en/flashduty">FlashDuty: One-Stop Alert Response Platform</a></nav><footer><div id="Ft"><b><a class="site" href="//flashcat.cloud"></a><b>Â© FlashCat Cloud</b><b>Site Build By <a class="a" href="https://i18n.site">I18N.SITE</a></b></b><b><a href="//github.com/flashcatcloud">&#xe64c;</a></b></div></footer></main>
